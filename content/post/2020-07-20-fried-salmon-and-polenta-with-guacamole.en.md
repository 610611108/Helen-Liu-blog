玉米是全世界總產量最高的糧食，不僅可食用，也可做為工業原料使用，用途非常廣泛又環保。玉米在每個國家習慣的烹飪方法都不同，在我們國家多是水煮居多。Polenta是玉米糊的意思，源自義大利的一道傳統美食。義大利人喜愛將玉米研磨製成玉米碎粉(並非像白白細細的那種玉米澱粉，這是與中國的涼粉不同之處)後，加水與鹽巴混和後加熱，使澱粉糊化後作為主食食用。當玉米糊冷卻後會變成塊狀，也就是所謂的玉米糕了。原理就像中國的涼粉一樣，只是中國使用的澱粉來源以綠豆、碗豆、地瓜、馬鈴薯為主。玉米糕製成後，再以油脂半煎半炸方式烹調後食用。

[Recipe from  SANPELLEGRINO](https://www.sanpellegrinofruitbeverages.com/intl/citrus/italian-food-recipes/fried-polenta)

**Fried polenta**

**Ingredients**
- 200 gr of polenta
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt

**RECIPE**\
The making of polenta requires a great deal of time, and is cooked under a low flame inside a cauldron, and should be constantly stirred throughout the entire process. Fortunately, today pre-packaged polenta exists and can ease the process of making crispy fried polenta.

**PREPARATION**\
Cut the polenta in slices of at least 1 cm wide. Alternatively, you can dice it in 1 cm cubes; any smaller would make them break apart during the cooking. Dry the polenta with a paper towel to reduce the humidity. In a saucepan, heat up an abundant amount of extravirgin olive oil to deep fry the pieces of polenta.

When the oil is hot, dip the pieces of polenta – small amounts at a time to keep the oil hot and guarantee the right amount of space for the polenta to fry perfectly. Fry the polenta for at least 10/15 minutes until the exterior turns into a golden crispy crust. Drain the fried polenta and place it in a piece of cardboard for fried food, season with a pinch of salt and serve while it’s still warm!
